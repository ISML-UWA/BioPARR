## Description
BioPARR (Biomechanics based Prediction of Aneurysm Rupture Risk) is a software system that facilitates the analysis of
abdominal aortic aneurisms (AAA) and evaluation of rupture risk using a finite element analysis based approach.

Except for semi-automatic segmentation of the AAA and intraluminal thrombus (ILT) from medical images,
the entire analysis is performed automatically. The system is modular and easily expandable, allows
the extraction of information from images of different modalities (CT, MRI) and the simulation of
different modelling scenarios.
