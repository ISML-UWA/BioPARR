Info about this programm:

ACVD [1] and ACVDQ [2]  are two programs for 3D triangular surface remeshing. They handle triangular meshes with any genus and any number of boundaries.

execute ACVD.exe and ACVDQ.exe to see the available options.
(respectively ACVD and ACVDQ for linux)

the output of the program is written in the file simplification.ply

additionnally, when running ACVD, a file output_1.ply is also written. It is the output mesh before post-processing using quadrics.

If your computer complains about missing dlls, google is your friend!
